  "category": "desserts",          // Valid category
  "description": "Brief description (1-2 sentences)",
  "prepTime": "15 mins",          // Be specific
  "cookTime": "30 mins",          // Actual cooking time
  "servings": "4",                // Number of servings
  "featured": false,              // Only for exceptional recipes
  "images": [                     // High-quality images
    "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-xxxxx?w=800"
  ],
  "ingredients": [                // Precise measurements
    "1 cup all-purpose flour",
    "2 large eggs",
    "1/2 tsp salt"
